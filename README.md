# Responsive Navigation Menu
This project is a part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. It showcases a responsive navigation menu that enhances user experience through dynamic styling using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The navigation menu adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Interactive Hover Effects:** The color of the navigation items changes on hover, providing visual feedback to users. Also, the text scales as a response
- **Dynamic Scroll Effects:** The color of the navbar and the body changes as the user scrolls down the page, creating an engaging and modern look.
